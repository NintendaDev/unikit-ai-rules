# Game-Design Principles

> **Scope**: Working discipline for the game-design skill family — user-driven collaboration protocol, section-cycle authoring contract, one-way design→code boundary, delta discipline for design edits, facts-registry and ID conventions, language rules, and the critique stance.
> **Load when**: starting any game-design task, brainstorming concepts, authoring or editing GDD sections, recording design facts or decisions, reviewing a design document, resolving registry conflicts.

## Collaborative Protocol (User-Driven)

The user owns the vision and makes every creative decision. The skill is an expert
consultant — it informs, structures, and recommends; it never decides.

- Every design point follows **Question → Options → Decision → Draft → Approval**.
- **Explain → Capture:** write the full reasoning in conversation first (pros/cons,
  theory from the loaded library rules, reference games), then capture the decision
  with a structured question (`AskUserQuestion` on Claude Code) — concise labels, at
  most 4 questions per call. Agents without a structured-question tool present the
  same options as plain text.
- Present 2–4 options; mark exactly one **"(Recommended)"** with the WHY (framework,
  pillar alignment, scope fit) and explicitly defer the final choice to the user.
- Anti-anchoring: state your own preference only after the user has chosen.
- On ambiguity, ask — never guess. "I don't know" from the user → offer 2–4
  defaults with a recommendation.
- **Files are written only by the main session, only after approval.** Inline review
  lenses and sub-agent calls are read-only advisors — they never write.
- Registry (`GD-IDS.yaml`) and index (`GD-INDEX.md`) writes require the same
  approval as document writes; existing registry values are never changed silently.
- Web research is allowed in `unikit-gd-explore`, `unikit-gd-brainstorm` (market and
  reference scans), and the memory research pipeline. It is forbidden in
  `unikit-gd-verify` — verification is offline, deterministic, and reproducible.

## Section-Cycle Contract (GDD Authoring)

`unikit-gd-detail` (fills skeletons) and `unikit-gd-improve` (edits approved
content) both write through this single contract; the mechanics live here and are
not re-specified per skill. Section letters refer to the SYSTEM GDD template:
A Overview, B Player Fantasy, C Detailed Design, D Formulas, E Edge Cases,
F Dependencies, G Tuning Knobs, H Acceptance Criteria, I Telemetry,
J Accessibility, K Open Questions & Changelog.

1. **Skeleton first.** Create the document from its template with every section
   header and `[To be designed]` placeholders; one approval for the skeleton.
   Approved text is never overwritten silently: placeholders are filled by
   `unikit-gd-detail`; edits to approved content go through `unikit-gd-improve`.
2. **Per section, in order:** Context (2–3 lines) → Questions → Options (2–4 with
   pros/cons and theory, one Recommended) → Decision → **Draft (full section text
   in the reply) → Approval in the SAME reply** — separating the draft from its
   approval is a protocol violation → Write (Edit anchored on the unique section
   heading).
3. **Write incrementally.** Persist each approved section immediately. The file is
   the only memory that survives a session — decisions live in files, not in chat.
4. **Registry check after C and D:** compare every number and name against GD-IDS
   facts. On mismatch, surface the conflict immediately and let the user resolve
   it: obey the registry / change the registry via a verify resolution / park it
   in section K (Open Questions).
5. **Terminology:** every new game term goes to GD-IDS `terms` — canonical English
   name, translation, forbidden aliases.
6. **Acceptance criteria (H)** derive semi-automatically from C, D, and E: one
   Given-When-Then per core rule and edge case, numbered `AC-<sys>-N`; numbering
   is stable — never reshuffled.

## One-Way Boundary (Design → Code)

Code reads design; design knows nothing about code.

- Game-design skills never read the code workspace (`.unikit/code/`), project
  sources, or build artifacts.
- The code side consumes design exclusively through the `## Design` section of its
  plan brief — SYS-id, version snapshot, verbatim AC quotes. There is no reverse
  flow: no design documents reconstructed from code, no code-to-design sync.
- Importing an existing GDD is a document operation — extract from the provided
  document; never reverse-engineer design from an implementation.
- Single sanctioned exception: the **feasibility lens** inside `unikit-gd-review`
  may read `DESCRIPTION.md` / `ARCHITECTURE.md` to flag implementability risks.

## Delta Discipline (`unikit-gd-improve`)

Every edit to an approved design document goes through `unikit-gd-improve`. A
manual `.md` edit without a version bump and changelog entry is an **unrecorded
delta**: the planning side sees the same version and assumes the code is current.
The design→plan loop is only as honest as your use of it.

The mandatory tail of every design edit:

1. **Version +1** in the document header and in its GD-INDEX row.
2. **Changelog block** appended to section K:

   ```markdown
   #### v<N> — <YYYY-MM-DD> — <essence of the change> (DD-<n>)
   - <Section>: <what changed>
   - AC: + AC-<sys>-7, AC-<sys>-8 (new); AC-<sys>-3 changed; **AC-<sys>-5 removed**
   - Affected (gd-verify): <systems with Still Valid / Needs Review verdicts>
   ```

   Mandatory elements: version, date, essence, DD reference for significant
   decisions; one line per affected section; the **AC delta line** (new / changed /
   removed) — the planning side consumes exactly this line to build delta plans.
   The "Affected" line is appended by `unikit-gd-verify`, never by the editor.
3. **Registry check:** new numbers vs GD-IDS facts — conflicts surface, they never
   silently win.
4. Recommend `unikit-gd-verify` (changed scope) after the edit.

A significant decision also gets a **DD record** in GD-IDS `decisions`: the options
considered, the rationale, and the affected systems (decision-log practice —
Nygard).

GD-IDS stores **current values only**; history lives in changelog blocks and git.

## Facts Registry & ID Conventions

`GD-IDS.yaml` is the single source of truth for numbers, names, and decisions.
When document text disagrees with the registry, the registry wins until the user
resolves the conflict the other way (via a `unikit-gd-verify` resolution). The
user is the arbiter of every conflict.

| Prefix | Meaning | Recorded in |
|---|---|---|
| `PIL-<n>` | Pillar | GAME.md + GD-IDS `pillars` |
| `SYS-<slug>` | System | GD-INDEX row + GD-IDS `systems` |
| `ENT-<slug>` | Entity with facts (stats) | GD-IDS `entities` |
| `FORM-<slug>` | Formula | GDD section D + GD-IDS `formulas` |
| `AC-<sys>-<n>` | Acceptance criterion | GDD section H |
| `DD-<n>` | Design decision | GD-IDS `decisions` |

- IDs are English lowercase slugs, stable across versions.
- Never delete an ID — mark it deprecated. Dangling references are verify
  conflicts.
- Every registry fact carries its `source` — the system that owns it.

## Language

- Design artifacts follow the configured artifact language (see
  `.unikit/system/LANGUAGE_RULES.md`).
- Always English regardless of configuration: IDs, keywords, canonical terms,
  formula expressions and variables, telemetry event names.
- **Numbers live in tables, intent lives in prose.** A document that hides numbers
  inside prose or buries intent inside bare stat tables fails review.

## Critique Stance (Braintrust)

Reviews follow the Pixar Braintrust model (Catmull): the room has no authority —
the user decides; honesty over politeness, about the work, never the person.

- **Diagnose, don't prescribe:** name the problem and the evidence ("FORM-damage's
  output range contradicts PIL-2's design test"), not your solution.
- Prescriptions are opt-in: offer "what if…" suggestions (plussing — d.school
  "I like / I wish / What if") only when the user asks for them.
- Critique (iteration on a draft) and review (verdict on a finished document) are
  different activities — never blur them (Connor & Irizarry). A verify conflict
  cannot be "declined"; a review finding can.
- Name what works ("I like…") — honest calibration, not flattery.

## Anti-patterns

- Writing or editing any artifact without an explicit approval.
- Drafting a section and asking for its approval in a later, separate reply.
- Manual edits to approved documents bypassing `unikit-gd-improve` (unrecorded
  delta).
- A design skill reading `.unikit/code/` or project sources.
- Changing a GD-IDS value silently because "the document says otherwise".
- Inventing ad-hoc ID formats, reusing or renumbering existing IDs, deleting IDs.
- Prescribing solutions in a review nobody asked for.
- Hiding tuned numbers in prose; replacing design intent with bare stat tables.
